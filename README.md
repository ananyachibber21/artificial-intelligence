Artificial Intelligence is not just about working with robots.  It is a technique for teaching a computer or software to think intelligently, similar to the human mind. AI is achieved by studying human brain patterns and analyzing the cognitive process. These studies result in the development of intelligent software and systems. AI is a vast field, and understanding the entire concept requires a step-by-step approach. Let us examine it in a systematic manner.

### Machine Learning 

Machine Learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence. Using algorithms, it is possible to create human-like intelligent machines. Understanding artificial intelligence requires understanding of machine learning algorithms and basic data science in order to perform mathematical calculations. This is my repository for Machine Learning and Data Science in detail-[Machine Learning and Data Science 101 guide](https://github.com/ananyachibber21/machine-learning).

### Computer Vision

Computer vision is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs — and then act or recommend on that information.

Computer vision is also important in facial recognition applications, which allow computers to match images of people's faces to their identities. Computer vision algorithms detect facial features in images and compare them to face profile databases.

### Deep Learning

Deep learning is a machine learning subfield that deals with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is a component of AI. Artificial intelligence is a machine's ability to mimic intelligent human behavior.

Deep learning models are capable of recognizing complex patterns in images, text, sounds, and other data in order to generate accurate insights and predictions.

### Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability of a computer programme to understand spoken and written human language, also known as natural language. It is part of artificial intelligence (AI).

It assists the computer system in comprehending the literal meaning as well as recognising the sentiments, tone, opinions, thoughts, and other elements that comprise a proper conversation.
